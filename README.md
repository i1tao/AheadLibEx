# AheadLibEx (Rust)

Rust rewrite this project. It inspects a DLL’s export table and generates the proxy sources you need to build a hijack DLL, plus an optional ready-to-open Visual Studio project.


## Refactor Timeline

- **2025-12-01**: Rebuilt the GUI layer in Rust with a fixed layout, unified theming, and decoupled event handling.
